      <h3>Sample post: A new interpreter appears</h3>
      <p class="blog-meta">Date: 2025‑01‑01 • Category: Interpreters</p>
      <p>
        Today I found a new interpreter project that aims to support both classic Scott Adams
        adventures and a few later variants. What I like most is the clear code structure and
        thorough comments that explain how the engine processes verbs, nouns, and room transitions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I added it to the Repositories page and made notes about its design trade‑offs. Over time,
        I want to compare this interpreter to others and see how each one handles edge cases.

      <h3>Sample post: Revisiting the story file format</h3>
      <p class="blog-meta">Date: 2025‑01‑10 • Category: Reverse engineering</p>
      <p>
        After reading through a detailed story file specification, I opened a few game files in a
        hex editor and started matching the documented fields to the actual bytes. It is satisfying
        to see how a compact format can still represent a surprisingly rich world.
      </p>
      <p>
        My next step will be to add a small section to the Tutorials page that walks through this
        process for others who are curious but unsure where to start.
