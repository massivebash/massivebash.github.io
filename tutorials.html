      <h2>Getting started with zero budget</h2>
      <p>
        All of the steps on this page are designed to be possible with free tools and services.
        You do not need paid software to play or build Scott Adams–style adventures.
      </p>

      <h3>Tutorial 1: Play a game using a modern interpreter</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Find an interpreter:</strong> Pick one of the engines from the <a href="repos.html">repositories</a> page.</li>
        <li><strong>Read its README:</strong> Look for instructions about prerequisites (.NET, Python, etc.).</li>
        <li><strong>Install what you need:</strong> Only use free runtimes and tools suggested by the project.</li>
        <li><strong>Get a story file:</strong> Some engines include sample games; others point to legal archives.</li>
        <li><strong>Run the interpreter:</strong> Follow the project’s examples to load and play the adventure.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Once this works, you have a working setup for exploring other compatible games as well.
      </p>

      <h3>Tutorial 2: Explore a story file</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Locate documentation:</strong> Find a story file specification or reverse‑engineering project.</li>
        <li><strong>Open a story file in a hex editor:</strong> Use any free hex editor or viewer.</li>
        <li><strong>Compare with the spec:</strong> Match header fields, room tables, and text sections.</li>
        <li><strong>Take notes:</strong> Write down how rooms and objects are represented in the file.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        You do not need to modify anything; just understanding the structure is a powerful step.
      </p>

      <h3>Tutorial 3: Create a tiny adventure with an authoring tool</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Choose a tool:</strong> Pick an authoring environment from the repo list.</li>
        <li><strong>Install or build it:</strong> Follow the project’s instructions using only free dependencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Create a minimal game:</strong> One starting room, one object, one simple puzzle.</li>
        <li><strong>Compile or export:</strong> Produce a story file or format supported by an interpreter.</li>
        <li><strong>Playtest:</strong> Run your game in a compatible engine and fix any problems.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Keep the first game extremely small. The goal is to complete the loop from authoring to
        playing at least once.

      <h2>Document your own journey</h2>
      <p>
        As you work through these tutorials, you can add your own notes and screenshots to the
        blog section of this site. That way, your learning process becomes part of the documentation
        for others.
