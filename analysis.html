      <h2>What does the GitHub activity look like?</h2>
      <p>
        This page gives a narrative overview of how interest in Scott Adams–style adventures is
        showing up on GitHub: which languages people choose, which types of projects are most
        common, and how activity has changed over time.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h3>Types of projects</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Interpreters:</strong> Engines that load and run game data from original or compatible formats.</li>
        <li><strong>Compilers:</strong> Tools that convert human‑readable scripts into story files.</li>
        <li><strong>Authoring environments:</strong> Editors or GUIs that make it easier to build adventures.</li>
        <li><strong>Reverse‑engineering:</strong> Disassemblies, notes, and technical docs about old binaries.</li>
        <li><strong>Ports and experiments:</strong> Re‑implementations for new platforms or creative remixes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When you survey the repositories, you will likely see clusters of similar efforts, often
        created by different people who discovered the games at different times.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h3>Language and platform trends</h3>
      <p>
        Most modern re‑implementations use languages that make cross‑platform deployment easier:
        C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, or portable C/C++. You may also spot hobbyist projects
        in languages the original games never targeted, like Rust or Go.
      </p>
      <p>
        A common pattern is that someone writes a minimal engine in their favorite language, then
        gradually adds features as they understand more of the original design.
      </p>

    <section class="card">
      <h3>Activity over time</h3>
      <p>
        Interest in retro computing often comes in waves. You can manually inspect commit histories
        to see bursts of activity around certain years, then new bursts when another developer
        rediscovers the format or ports it to a new platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to be more systematic, you can record the creation dates and last‑updated dates
        of each repository in a spreadsheet and chart them by year.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h3>How to build your own charts (optional)</h3>
      <p>
        If you are comfortable editing a bit of code, you can embed charts using a free library
        like Chart.js. For example, you could show how many projects use each programming language.
      </p>
      <p>
        To keep this site fully static and free, you can hard‑code the data into a script and update
        it manually whenever you rescan GitHub.
      </p>
      <pre><code>&lt;!-- Example placeholder for a chart container --&gt;
&lt;canvas id="languageChart" width="400" height="200"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;
&lt;!-- You would then include a small script referencing Chart.js --&gt;</code></pre>

      <h2>How to keep this analysis honest</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Be explicit:</strong> Say when you are estimating versus measuring.</li>
        <li><strong>Show your criteria:</strong> Explain how you chose which repos to include.</li>
        <li><strong>Update periodically:</strong> Retro projects come and go; re‑scan GitHub sometimes.</li>
      </ul>
