      <h2>Who is Scott Adams in this context?</h2>
      <p>
        This website focuses on Scott Adams as an early pioneer of home‑computer text adventure
        games. His adventures were compact, portable, and designed to run on very limited hardware,
        which made them ideal candidates for ports, re‑implementations, and study.

      <h3>Early text adventure era</h3>
      <p>
        In the early days of personal computing, memory and storage were extremely limited. Text
        adventures had to pack rooms, objects, puzzles, and parser logic into tiny amounts of space.
        Scott Adams adventures became known for their clever compression and efficient data formats.

      <h3>The engine and data format</h3>
      <p>
        A key idea behind these games was separating the engine from the data. The interpreter
        handled parsing and game logic, while the story file contained rooms, objects, vocabulary,
        and messages. This separation allowed the same engine to run multiple adventures.
      </p>
      <p>
        That structure is exactly what attracts modern developers on GitHub: it is a compact, clear
        example of an engine‑data architecture that can be studied, ported, and reimagined.

      <h3>Why people still care</h3>
      <p>
        Some developers are motivated by nostalgia; others treat these games as a kind of puzzle:
        how do you fit a whole world into such tight constraints? For reverse engineers, the
        original interpreters and story files are fascinating case studies in practical design.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result is a steady stream of GitHub projects that preserve, document, or extend this
        family of adventures.

      <h2>From floppy disks to GitHub repos</h2>
      <p>
        Originally distributed on tape and disk, the games now live on in disk images, archives,
        and code repositories. Each GitHub project featured on this site is part of a larger effort
        to keep that history understandable and accessible.
